== Description ==

Reverse Top Comments is a WordPress Plugin which can be used to reverse the order in which the top level comments are shown in a WordPress blog, 
without modifying the theme. Nested comments are displayed in non-reverse order. 

== Installation ==

Upload the file to your WordPress Plugin directory and then activate it from the Plugins page.

Make sure your discussion settings are set so that "comments should be displayed with the **older** comments at the top of each page", and 
start display at the first page. Let this plugin do the reversing so that the first page is always full of the correct number of entries.
